# Web servers

## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
- Do one thing and do it well
  Each of the commands in Linux is fairly small, and each performs a specific task well.
- Use Software Leverage
  Never rewrite code that has already been written.

## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
VPS is a virtual server constructed in the physical host computer. You can use it for whatever you want. VPS has more reliability and you can gain total control because VPS is used by only one user in contrast to shared server.

## Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
it's because, if we deleted core files or some important files by running programs as the root user, we could never restore those files.
