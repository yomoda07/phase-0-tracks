# jQuery

## Study Plan
  - I will mainly use [documentation](https://api.jquery.com) as a reference.
  - I would test my code out frequently to detect bug quickly.
  - I'm not going to take a break, because I prefer concentrating 2 hours to separating it by taking breaks.
  - I'm gonna build a menu bar and some contents with toggle to understand how jQuery works because menu bar has a lot of stuff to implement and I think it would be better to learn jQuery.


## Reflect
- Testing code frequently was effective because sometimes I don't really know which element I actually selected.
